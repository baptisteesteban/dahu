# Level lines distance transform and geodesic distance transform comparison

This repository provides an implementation of the level lines distance transform
([link](https://hal.science/hal-05336328/document)) and of the geodesic distance
transform
([link](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Toby-Sharp/publication/221304156_GeoS_Geodesic_Image_Segmentation/links/54a686a60cf256bf8bb61e66/GeoS-Geodesic-Image-Segmentation.pdf)). Furthermore, it provides a GUI application for comparison purposes.

## How to use it

This package is handled by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). You can launch the
GUI using the following command:

```
$ uv run python gui/main.py
```

# Dahu pseudo-distance computation

This repository provides an implementation of the level lines distance transform
([link](https://hal.science/hal-05336328/document)) as well as a derived
implementation of the Dahu pseudo-distance
([link](https://inria.hal.science/hal-01476258/document)) for grayscale images
(encoded as uint8 Numpy array).

## How to use it

This package is handled by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). You may run the
companion notebook to test the package :

```
$ uv run jupyter notebook
```
